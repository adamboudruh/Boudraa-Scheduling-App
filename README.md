## Description
myPlanner is a scheduling application built using the MERN stack. With this app, users are able to create employees with customizable availabilities, make shifts for those employees, and export the created schedules. Currently the backend of the application has been completed and the front-end is in development. The front-end will use React-admin and AWS Cognito for authentication.
